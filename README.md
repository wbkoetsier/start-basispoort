Script to start Basispoort and log in in one click

## Introduction
[Veilig leren lezen](https://www.zwijsen.nl/lesmethoden/veilig-leren-lezen) is a Dutch method for teaching 6-year-olds to read. Part of this method is a software package, which includes access to a website where the children can practice and play games from home. At my daughter's school, the children access the software from a desktop computer. At home, my daughter uses my laptop, and frequently switches between the mouse and the touchpad, and between the on-screen keyboard and the laptop keyboard. Besides practising reading, she practises her mouse and keyboard skills as well.

At my laptop (Ubuntu), the following steps are needed to start playing: turn the laptop on, start a browser, navigate to https://thuis.basispoort.nl/, enter username and password to login and click one of the 2 buttons to enter the game-area.

Of course, parents should be involved. However, I find it convenient if my daughter can log in to the website without help to start playing. I could find some methods to easily do this, but I decided to create this script instead. My daughter practises reading, I brush up on browser automation.
